## Compiled APKs
In the Build folder, we offer two different APKs. Since we used some paid assets (mainly for 3D models), we provide an APK with these paid assets and one without. The latter is compiled based on the code and assets available in this Git repository.

* **Bans.apk** is compiled including paid assets and thus, the Bans and environments with all functions.
* **VRception-Github.apk** is compiled with the source code in this Github repository. This version has the paid assets removed; thus, excluding some 3D models.
